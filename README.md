# Arabidopsis_cotyledon_celltype_identification

The software can identify cell types of Arabidopsis cotyledons using single-cell RNA sequencing data. Compared with manual identification, the cell types representing different stages of stomatal development in Arabidopsis cotyledons can be quickly obtained by inputting the scrna expression data to be identified.
